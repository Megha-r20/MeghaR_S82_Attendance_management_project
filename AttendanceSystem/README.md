# Attendance Management Project

## Description
This project is part of a Code-Along series to build an Attendance Management System using Java.  
In this part, we have set up the basic project structure and verified that the environment works.

## Project Structure

## Session 2: Core Domain Modelling
- Defined `Student` class with `studentId`, `name`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` methods.
- Defined `Course` class with `courseId`, `courseName`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` methods.
- Utilized arrays of objects in `Main.java` to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of the `this` keyword.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile:

## Part 3: Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation
- Implemented parameterized constructors in `Student` and `Course` classes for object initialization.
- Utilized `private static` member variables for automatic and unique ID generation.
- Demonstrated the use of the `this` keyword to distinguish instance variables from constructor parameters.
- Changed `Course`'s `courseId` to `int` for simpler auto-generation and updated its display.
- Updated `Main.java` to use constructors and show ID progression.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
